## Lab 8 Works
    1. 
        -  Added PostIdContext.js file that uses useContent().
        -  instead of sending props from Dashboard to PostDetails, useContent() is used.
    
    2. 
        - useRef() is used in NewPost.js
        - It replaces state(newPost) variable created using a useState() hook.
        - handleOnChange() is no longer needed ato update the state for each input field. Instead, the form's data is accessed 
          directly  from the form element when needed, typically on form submission.
